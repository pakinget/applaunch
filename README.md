# applaunch
A simple bash script made to launch applications from the terminal

## Why?
I was messing around with my Kubuntu and managed to get latte-dock crashing after the PC goes idle. Turned out that it doesn't have an option to start from the terminal so I developed a whole ass bash script to launch any app

## How?
The script searches through /usr/share/applications to find an exec path to your app and then launches it

## AppImages
I'll work on it later(tm). Since they aren't in the applications folder, you can't launch them using this script
